A mobile virtual network operator or MVNO is a wireless communications service provider. Unlike traditional mobile network operators (MNOs), MVNOs do not own the infrastructure they use. Instead, they lease it from MNOs and use the infrastructure to deliver a unique set of services to their markets. MVNOs acquire bulk access to an MNO’s services at discounted or wholesale rates and set retail prices for sale to consumers.

Tesco Mobile is an MVNO. It offers cell phones, call plans, and data as an MVNO. Tesco Mobile is able to be an MVNO by leveraging O2’s mobile network infrastructure


## What does an MVNO do?

MVNOs don’t invest in mobile network infrastructure but must provide other important services that support their clients. These are services that help MVNOs transfer value and positive brand experiences:

* Marketing and promoting products
* Managing billing and invoicing of clients for services
* Subscriber registration to the network
* Offering subscriber services like balance checks, network top-ups, customer care, and SMS capabilities
* Distribution of assets like SIM cards and mobile phones
